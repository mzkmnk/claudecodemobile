# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository called "claudecodemobile" that currently contains only a basic README.md file. The repository appears to be in its initial state with no source code, build configuration, or development tooling set up yet.

## Current State

- The repository is empty except for a README.md file
- No package.json, build tools, or development dependencies are configured
- No source code structure exists yet
- No testing framework or linting tools are set up

## Development Notes

Since this is a new/empty repository, development commands and architecture will need to be established as the project grows. When files are added, this CLAUDE.md should be updated to reflect:

- Build and development commands
- Project structure and architecture
- Testing and linting procedures
- Any specific development workflows
